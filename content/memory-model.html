			<h1 class="content-header">Value Semantics and the Memory Model</h1>
			<hr />

			<p>
			This chapter lays out the behaviour and semantics of values in Flax.
			</p>


			<h3 class="subcontent-header" id="value-types">Value Types</h3>
			<h3 class="anchor-clicker"></h3><p>

			There are 3 main types of values in Flax, one of which isn't really a value, just a wrapper type that encapsulates a certain
			kind of behaviour.
			</p>


			<aside class="note">
				<p class="note-title">Note</p>
				<p class="note-content">
				This is becoming like C++, which makes me slightly uneasy.
				</p>
			</aside>



			<h4 class="subcontent-header" id="type-lvalues">L-values</h4>
			<h4 class="anchor-clicker"></h4><p>

			In terms of the IR, these are either globals, or stack-allocated variables. In other words, lvalues will always have a pointer
			(ie. memory location) associated with the actual value.

			</p>




			<h4 class="subcontent-header" id="type-rvalues">R-values</h4>
			<h4 class="anchor-clicker"></h4><p>

			Again, in terms of the IR, these are normal values, with no memory location.

			rvalues can be assigned to lvalues, by virtue of storing the value into the memory location. In places where we need an lvalue,
			but only have an rvalue, an error will be thrown,

			I can think of several places in the compiler where we generate an lvalue from an rvalue by doing this:

<pre class="dcodesegment dcsouter"><code class="dcsinner">. stackalloc (make lvalue)
. store rvalue into stackalloc
. use stackalloc (lvalue)</code></pre>

			which needs to be eradicated.
			</p>


			<h4 class="subcontent-header" id="type-fwvalues">FW-values</h4>
			<h4 class="anchor-clicker"></h4><p>

			Name irrelevant; "function-wrapped values".

			Basically the getter/setter construct we see in some places, like subscript operators and computed properties.
			Fwvalues provide a getter function, and optionally a setter function.

			Like with any function, the getter function returns an rvalue, while the setter function takes rvalue arguments.
			</p>

<pre class="dcodesegment dcsouter"><code class="lang-swift dcsinner">
class Foo
{
	var x: int
	{
		get { 10 }
		set { printf("nice try\n"); }
	}
}</code></pre>

			<p>
			In the case above, <code>foo.x</code> is of fwvalue type.
			</p>





			<h4 class="subcontent-header" id="values-behaviour">Behaviour</h4>
			<h4 class="anchor-clicker"></h4><p>

			Hopefully without reference types, these categories are easier to grok than the crazy value categories of C++. Below are a set of
			hopefully-comprehensive scenarios, and the kind of values that they generate.

			<ol>
				<li><code>var x</code>
					<ul>
						<li><code>x</code> is an value. When a variable is referenced by name like this, it always generates an lvalue.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>foo(...)</code>
					<ul>
						<li>The result of calling a function is always an rvalue.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>x = foo[...]</code>, or <code>x = foo.p</code> where <code>p</code> is a computed property
					<ul>
						<li>Subscripts and computed propertiees are special constructs; the result of such an operation is an fwvalue.</li>
						<li>Depending on whether the expression is used on the left or right, either the getter or setter is called.</li>
						<li>Obviously if no setter is available and the expression is on the left side, an error is thrown.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>foo[...] = x</code>, or <code>foo.p = x</code> where <code>p</code> is a computed property
					<ul>
						<li>Similar to the point above.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>x = foo(...)</code>
					<ul>
						<li>Function calls result in an rvalue.</li>
						<li><cod>x</cod> must be an lvalue for this statement to be valid.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>














			<h3 class="subcontent-header" id="copy-operator">Copy Operator</h3>
			<h3 class="anchor-clicker"></h3><p>

			The copy operator can only be declared for <code>class</code> types, not for <code>struct</code> types.
			Its definition takes this form:

<pre class="dcodesegment dcsouter"><code class="lang-swift dcsinner">
class Foo
{
	copy(other: Foo)
	{
		// initialise self
		self.x = other.x
	}
}</code></pre>
			</p>

			<p>
			If no copy operator is provided, none will be provided for you by the state. If a copy opeartor is needed and it's not defined,
			the compiler will throw an error.

			It is as yet undetermined whether this is is a net increase or decrease in programmer burden.
			</p>


			<h4 class="subcontent-header" id="copy-operator-behaviour">Behaviour</h4>
			<h4 class="anchor-clicker"></h4><p>

			Presented below are a set of hopefully-comprehensive scenarios in which the copy operator will be called.

			<ol>
				<li><code>foo = x</code></li>
				<li><code>foo(x)</code></li>
				<li><code>return x</code>
					<ul>
						<li>The copy operator is called on <code>foo</code>: <code>foo.copy(x)</code>, essentially.
							The behaviour is identical for the 3 cases above.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>foo(bar())</code>
					<ul>
						<li>Functions return an rvalue, and functions take rvalues as arguments. Hence, no copy operator is called in
							this scenario, and the result of <code>bar()</code> is passed directly to <code>foo</code>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>


			</p>









			<h3 class="subcontent-header" id="move-operator">Move Operator</h3>
			<h3 class="anchor-clicker"></h3><p>

			Like the copy operator, the move operator can only be defined on <code>class</code> types.
			The move operator takes this form:

<pre class="dcodesegment dcsouter"><code class="lang-swift dcsinner">
class Foo
{
	move(other: Foo)
	{
		// initialise self
		self.resource = other.resource
		other.resource = null
	}
}</code></pre>
			</p>

			<p>
			Note that while the copy and move operators take a similar form, they do fundamentally different things. The move operator is
			most useful when an object owns resources, like file descriptors or websockets, that cannot be *meaningfully* copied.
			</p>

			<p>
			To forbid copying instances of a certain class, the declaration for the copy operator is simply omitted; the compiler will
			always attempt to use the move operator if possible, before resorting to the copy operator. Again, if the copy operator is
			not defined but is needed, an error is thrown. However, if the move operator is not defined, then the copy operator can be
			used to substitute for – the reverse is *not* true.
			</p>

			<p>
			Like in C++, the move operator allows the transfer of 'ownership' from an rvalue to an lvalue, like in this case:

<pre class="dcodesegment dcsouter"><code class="lang-swift dcsinner">let x = openFileFromPathUsingMode("somefile.txt", "rw")
</code></pre>

			Since the function returns an rvalue, it is moved into the lvalue of <code>x</code>. However, something like this:

<pre class="dcodesegment dcsouter"><code class="lang-swift dcsinner">let y = x
</code></pre>

			would attempt to call the copy operator, since <code>x</code> is an lvalue, and <code>y</code> is an lvalue that is being assigned to.
			</p>

			<p>
			Since it would not make sense to define such an operator for a file object, its declaration would have been omitted, and the
			compiler will generate an error.
			</p>

			<p>
			Calling the move operator is equivalent to this: <code>x.move(result)</code>, where <code>result</code>
			is the rvalue resulting from the function call.

			In essence, the move operator enables the compiler to avoid creating temporary copies of objects that need to be constructed,
			only to be destructed a few lines later.
			</p>





			<h4 class="subcontent-header" id="move-operator-behaviour">Behaviour</h4>
			<h4 class="anchor-clicker"></h4><p>

			Presented below are a set of hopefully-comprehensive scenarios in which the move operator will be called.

			<ol>
				<li><code>x = foo()</code>
					<ul>
						<li>Functions return rvalues. If the type of <code>x</code> defines a move operator, then it is called. If not,
						the copy operator is called.</li>
						<li>This is equivalent to calling <code>x.move(foo())</code></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>x = foo[i]</code> or <code>x = foo.p</code></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Fwvalues cannot be moved from, even though they return rvalues.</li>
						<li>The class which the subscript or property belongs to typically 'owns' the resources being referred to. Hence,
						given that the actual instance of the class (<code>foo</code> here) is <i>not moved</i>, then its contents cannot
						be moved away from it.</li>
						<li>The scenarios above will result in calling the <i>copy operator</i>, if the type of <code>foo[i]</code> or
						<code>foo.p</code> is a class type.</li>
						<li>If such an operator does not exist, an error is thrown as usual.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>x = &lt;expr of x&gt;</code>
					<ul>
						<li>Given some random expression in <code>x</code>, for example an operator overload, the result of such an expression
						(that is not an fwvalue) will always be an rvalue.</li>
						<li>The behaviour in this case is identical to calling a function: <code>x.move(x + 1)</code>, assuming
						<code>+</code> is defined suitably.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>foo[i] = bar()</code>, or <code>foo.p = bar()</code> where <code>p</code> is a computed property
					<ul>
						<li>Similar to calling a function with the result of another function, since <code>bar()</code> results in an rvalue,
						the rvalue is passed directly to the setter of the fwvalue: <code>foo.p.set(bar())</code></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			</p>












			<h3 class="subcontent-header" id="reference-counting">Reference Counting</h3>
			<h3 class="anchor-clicker"></h3><p>

			Only <code>class</code> types can be reference, since structs are supposed to be value types; they shouldn't be managing any
			kind of memory or other "owned data".
			</p>

			<p>
			However, there is technically no real reason why <code>struct</code> types cannot be reference counted either...
			</p>

			<p>
			Declaring a certain variable to be reference counted makes the variable have a wrapper type, represented like this:

<pre class="dcodesegment dcsouter"><code class="lang-swift dcsinner">
struct rc
{
	let ptr: T*
	var refcount: i64
}

// ...

var foo: rc&lt;Foo&gt;</code></pre>

			Note that the data pointer is immutable, for obvious reasons. When a new variable of type <code>rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is created,
			memory for <code>T</code> is allocated on the heap, so the variable contains a pointer to a valid piece of memory.
			</p>

			<p>
			In terms of behaviour, <code>rc&lt;T&gt;</code> can be transparently
			casted to both an rvalue <code>T</code>, and an rvalue <code>T*</code> that can be used to access the lvalue <code>T</code>.
			This means that operations like this:

<pre class="dcodesegment dcsouter"><code class="lang-swift dcsinner">
class Foo
{
	var x: int
	init(a: int) { self.x = a }
}

operator + (a: Foo, b: int) -> Foo { return Foo(a.x + b) }

// ...

var x: rc&lt;Foo&gt; = Foo(10)
let y = x + 40
</code></pre>

			are valid, without having to explicitly deference or <i>unwrap</i> the <code>rc</code> type. However, there is a caveat:
			</p>

			<p>
			In the case of <code>x + 40</code>, <code>x</code> is implicitly unwrapped back to a <code>Foo</code> lvalue in order to call
			the <code>+</code> operator. After the operation, however, we are left with an rvalue of type <code>Foo</code>, that needs to be converted to a <code>rc&lt;Foo&gt;</code> lvalue. Thus, if <code>x + 40</code> is assigned to a value, eg.
			<code class="lang-swift">let y = x + 40</code> (note that <code>y</code> also has type <code>rc&lt;Foo&gt;</code>),
			<code>x</code> essentially has to get <i>moved</i> to the lvalue <code>y</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
			In this context, the rvalue of the operation is moved into the pointer, like this: <code>x.ptr.move(x + 40)</code>. The reference
			count of <code>x</code> is not modified. This is completely valid – the <code>let</code> (immutability) of the pointer in
			<code>rc</code> refers (in this case) only to the <i>value of the pointer</i>, not the object being pointed to. Thus, it is
			perfectly valid to call mutating functions on reference counted types.
			</p>




			<p>
			In terms of value semantics, <code>rc</code> types follow normal rules, in that <code>x</code> is an lvalue, and
			<code>x + 40</code> is an rvalue.
			</p>

			<p>
			To avoid subverting the reference counting system, reference counted lvalues cannot have their address taken, so
			<code>&amp;x</code> is an invalid operation. Besides, since <code>rc</code> is only a wrapper type, its address is
			completely meaningless.
			</p>

			<p>
			Finally, in declaring a variable <code>var x: rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, the initial reference count of <code>x</code> is defined to
			be <code>1</code>.
			</p>






			<h4 class="subcontent-header" id="refcounting-behaviour">Behaviour</h4>
			<h4 class="anchor-clicker"></h4><p>

			Presented below are a set of hopefully-comprehensive scenarios which are relevant to reference counted types:

			<ol>
				<li><code>foo = rc</code></li>
				<li><code>foo.x = rc</code>
					<ul>
						<li>The reference count of the original value of the variable being assigned to is decremented.</li>
						<li>The reference count of <code>rc</code> is incremented.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>rc = foo()</code>
					<ul>
						<li>The reference count of the original value of <code>rc</code> is decremented.</li>
						<li>The rvalue result of <code>foo()</code> is stored directly into <code>rc</code>, ie. The data pointer
						and the reference count are copied directly.</li>
						<li>With the behaviour detailed in (4), the new reference count of <code>rc</code> should be <cod>1</cod> after
						the function call</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>return rc</code>
					<ul>
						<li>The reference count of <code>rc</code> is incremented.</li>
						<li>The lvalue of <code>rc</code> is turned into an rvalue and returned, as usual. At the scope exit, the
						compiler decrements the reference count of <code>rc</code>.</li>
						<li>Since the refcount was artificially inflated by the return statement, <code>rc</code> is not deallocated, and
						the result returned by the function retains the data pointer of <code>rc</code>, and a reference count of
						<code>1</code>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><code>foo(rc)</code>
					<ul>
						<li>Functions taking <code>rc&lt;T&gt;</code> actually take <code>rc&lt;T&gt;*</code>. This has several implications
							<ul>
								<li>Rvalue expressions cannot be passed to functions, eg. <code>foo(x + 4)</code> is invalid if
								<code>x</code> is a reference counted type.</li>
								<li>The compiler needs to handle this inconvenience in codegen.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>This behaviour ensures that the <code>rc</code> is <i>not copied</i>, allowing the original reference count to
						be updated.</li>
						<li>The value being passed to the function <i>is</i>, for all intents and purposes, <code>rc</code>. If the
						callee prolongs the lifespan of <code>rc</code> (eg. by assigning it to some global), this should naturally
						prolong the lifespan of the original <code>rc</code>, and with this behaviour it will.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>















			<h3 class="subcontent-header" id="string-refcounting">String Reference Counting</h3>
			<h3 class="anchor-clicker"></h3><p>

			Strings essentially behave in the same, reference-counted manner as <code>rc</code> types.
			</p>

			<p>
			The string contains a length, in bytes, of the buffer, as well as said buffer, which is a null-terminated series of bytes.
			Built-in to the string representation is a 32-bit reference count – it's smaller than the default <code>rc&lt;T&gt;</code>,
			but this allows the string to fit into 16 bytes (on 64-bit platforms).
			</p>

			<p>
			Strings are represented as such:

<pre class="dcodesegment dcsouter"><code class="lang-swift dcsinner">
struct string
{
	let buffer: int8*
	let length: int32
	var refcount: int32
}</code></pre>

			Again, note that both the buffer and the length are immutable. Indeed, strings are immutable themselves. Operations that would
			modify a string instead return new strings.
			</p>

			<p>
			For example, in <code>x += &quot;foo&quot;</code>, it is actually <code>x = (x + &quot;foo&quot;)</code>, and the difference is
			that the string pointed to by <code>x</code> is not modified; <code>x</code> is given an entirely new string.
			</p>

			<p>
			Operations creating strings like these, or any expression like <code>&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;</code>, allocate memory for
			the new string on the heap. String literals like <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code>, on the other hand, are statically allocated as
			expected. The reference count of such strings cannot be modified, so they are never dereferenced.
			</p>

			<p>
			Differing from <code>rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is that, in passing strings to functions, the a new string object is created with the
			buffer being copied, which simplifies things on this end for now.
			</p>
